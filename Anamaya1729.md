## Technical Documentation for the Blockchain/Smart Contracts

### Introduction

This document describes the technical details of the blockchain and smart contracts used in the projects. It is intended for developers who want to understand the technical details of the projects.

### Blockchain

The blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions between two parties in a verifiable and permanent way. The blockchain used in the projects is based on the [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) blockchain framework. The blockchain is a permissioned blockchain, which means that only authorized participants can write transactions to the blockchain. The blockchain is also a private blockchain, which means that the blockchain is not publicly accessible. The blockchain is hosted on the IBM Cloud.

### Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are written in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/). The smart contracts are deployed to the blockchain using the [Hyperledger Fabric Chaincode for Node.js](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-chaincode-node/) module. The smart contracts are deployed to the blockchain using the [Hyperledger Fabric Client SDK for Node.js](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-1.4/) module.

### Blockchain Explorer
